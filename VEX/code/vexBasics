#   VEX - Vector expression language HOUDINI 
#   Attributes are the values carried by the geometry on point, primitive, vertex, or detail.
#   @P defines position - you can adjust position in space
#   Syntax - coding grammar
#   End of the line is finished with the ';'

#   h$cript - is houdini coding language
#   float - is the number with decimal places
#   integer - is whole numbers
#   string - is for text

#   Variables are temporary after code runs in houdini
